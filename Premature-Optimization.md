# Premature Optimization 

> Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. 

Lets focus on two (of many) possible reasons startups die: 

A.  no traction 
B.  tech stack impedes scaling 

It is far more common to die from A than B.  A means the product is broken, and your tech stack should optimize for building & refining features users will love, not prematurely optimizing for scale.

> Your startup might die if the tech stack you use can't scale up.

Can you show some examples of this? Are there any instances of startups dying because their tech stack prohibited scaling?

Lastly, since you're characterizing advice of the man who runs/ran most successful tech incubator in the world as `cliche BS startup lines`, your problems run much deeper than Meteor-related scaling and premature optimization.

"Get it working before you optimize it. The most basic argument for prototyping first is Kernighan & Plauger's; “90% of the functionality delivered now is better than 100% of it delivered never”. Prototyping first may help keep you from investing far too much time for marginal gains. For slightly different reasons, Donald Knuth (author of The Art Of Computer Programming, one of the field's few true classics) popularized the observation that “Premature optimization is the root of all evil”.[11] And he was right.
