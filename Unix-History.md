# Unix History 

After the 1974 paper (claiming 600 installations, up from 10 in 1972, research labs and universities all over the world clamored for the chance to try out Unix themselves. 

Was open source born because of an odd legal quirk? 

Under a 1958 consent decree in settlement of an antitrust case, AT&T (the parent organization of Bell Labs) had been forbidden from entering the computer business. 

Unix could not, therefore, be turned into a product; under the terms of the consent decree, Bell Labs was required to license its nontelephone technology to anyone who asked!

Ken Thompson quietly began answering requests by shipping out tapes and disk packs — each, according to legend, with a note signed “love, ken”.

Unix machines were only available to big organizations with big budgets: corporations, universities, government agencies. 

But use of minicomputers was less regulated than the even-bigger mainframes, and Unix development rapidly took on a countercultural air. It was the early 1970s; the pioneering Unix programmers were shaggy hippies and hippie-wannabes. 

They delighted in playing with an operating system that not only offered them fascinating challenges at the leading edge of computer science, but also subverted all the technical assumptions and business practices that went with Big Computing.

ARPANET hackers learned C and began to speak the jargon of pipes, filters, and shells; 

Unix programmers learned TCP/IP and started to call each other “hackers”. 

The process of fusion was accelerated after the Project Jupiter cancellation in 1983 killed the PDP-10's future.  The Jargon File, born on the ARPANET but revised on Usenet, aptly symbolized the merger.)

## RMS and the Manifesto 

It did not help RMS's case that, although his Free Software Foundation had produced most of the rest of a full software toolkit, it failed to deliver the central piece. Ten years after the founding of the GNU project, there was still no GNU kernel. While individual tools like Emacs and GCC proved tremendously useful, GNU without a kernel neither threatened the hegemony of proprietary Unixes nor offered an effective counter to the rising problem of the Microsoft monopoly.
