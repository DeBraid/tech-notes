# The Sovereign Individual 

### Mastering the Transition to the Information Age

These are notes from reading the book, mostly paraphrased, but contains some direct quotes.  Published Aug 26 1999, on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.ca/Sovereign-Individual-Mastering-Transition-Information/dp/0684832720)

# Chapter 1: The Year 2000

There is another industrial revolution afoot on Earth.  The Information Age is going to bring about radical changes in the political establishment.  Our 21st century comforts will morph into post-modern reality where bandwidth trumps borders and the sovereignty of the individual will usurp the State.

> Increasingly autonomous individuals and bankrupt, desperate governments will confront each other across a new divide.  We expect a radical restructuring of the nature of sovereignty and the **virtual death of politics** before the transition is over. 

Information technology will erode the ability for the state to charge more for services than they are worth, as privatization of service provision rises.

Tech enables a dramatic extension of markets by altering the way assets are created and protected.  

> Citizenship will go the way of chivalry. 

Denationalized citizens will no longer be citizens as we know them, but customers.  **Sovereign Individuals** will bargain for whatever limited government they need and pay for it according to contract.

Like the [Knights of Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta), aka The Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a modern Rome-based continuation of the medieval Knights Hospitaller.  They operate a sovereign entity issuing money, creating laws and maintaining a military.  An old example of what could arise in great mass all over the globe as mega-sovereigns (modern developed economies, like G20) disaggregate into smaller entities. 

> As virtual communities gain coherence they will insist their members be held accountable to their own laws, rather than those of a nation-state which they happen to reside. 

Power of government will be eroded as newer alternatives appear.  For example, YCombinator is about to start its minimum income experiment in Oakland.  It's easy to see how large, powerful private entities like YC can influence communities, and attract people into its sphere of influence by providing something people love.  Money, security, community, all from a private establishment...


## Megapolitical

Big picture writing on transition of society would not be complete without acknowledging the role of violence.  History has a long track record of people looking to profit from violence, because sadly, it often pays very well.

The lack of clear thought put into this going forward would be foolish, so we look to history for guidance.  There are few [examples][playfair] of in the literature and one of the best was published in 1804
