# Chapter 1: The Year 2000

There is another industrial revolution afoot on Earth.  The Information Age is going to bring about radical changes in the political establishment.  Our 21st century comforts will morph into post-modern reality where bandwidth trumps borders and the sovereignty of the individual will trump that of states.

> Increasingly autonomous individuals and bankrupt, desperate governments will confront each other across a new divide.  We expect a radical restructuring of the nature of sovereignty and the **virtual death of politics** before the transition is over. 

Information technology will erode the ability for the state to charge more for services than they are worth, as privatization of service provision rises.

Tech enables a dramatic extension of markets by altering the way assets are created and protected.  

> Citizenship will go the way of chivalry. 

Denationalized citizens will no longer be citizens as we know them, but customers.  **Sovereign Individuals** will bargain for whatever limited government they need and pay for it according to contract.

Like the [Knights of Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta), aka The Sovereign Military Order of Malta, a modern Rome-based continuation of the medieval Knights Hospitaller.  They operate a sovereign entity issuing money, creating laws and maintaining a military.  An old example of what could arise in great mass all over the globe as mega-sovereigns (modern developed economies, like G20) disaggregate into smaller entities. 

> As virtual communities gain coherence they will insist their members be held accountable to their own laws, rather than those of a nation-state which they happen to reside.
