## Title: How Technology Is Changing Toronto Employment 

Intro The first two sections
provide a quantitative overview of both the Toronto economy at
large and the growing tech ecosystem within it. The third section
outlines our policy recommendations.

Of these, 93,000 jobs are held by selfemployed professionals, accounting for 23% of the ecosystem, which is more significant than other industries in Toronto. In comparison to two other significant Toronto industries in 2015, only 4% of the manufacturing workforce was self-employed, and only 8% of the finance and insurance workforce was self-employed.

Toronto has a growing startup ecosystem containing 2,500–4,100 active tech startups, contributing to 51,000 new jobs in the last 6 years.

Toronto-centric growth isn’t uniform across the entire ecosystem. Since 2010, non-tech jobs in tech industries declined by 1.1%.  Tech jobs in nontech industries grew by 15.7%, while tech jobs in tech industries saw the largest percentage growth, at 27.1%. 

There are no less than 18 different incubators and accelerators across Toronto’s universities and colleges.

- Ryerson University: Digital Media Zone, the Fashion Zone, Innovation Centre for Urban Energy 
- University of Toronto: Department of Computer Science Innovation Lab, Impact Centre, Creative Destruction Lab, the Entrepreneurship Hatchery, the Hub Ideation and Experimental Learning Centre, among others 
- York University: LaunchYU, York Entrepreneurship Development Institute Accelerator 
- Centennial College: Centre for Entrepreneurship, Student Business Incubator, Wireless Acceleration program in partnership with Wavefront 
- George Brown College: Digital Media and Gaming Incubator, EmpoweredYouth Startup Hub, Prototyping Lab 
- Humber College: Humber Launch Seneca College: The Health Entrepreneurship and Lifestyle Exchange (HELIX) incubator 

Accelerators and incubators that explicitly serve Toronto’s tech sector include: Brightspark Venture, Driven Accelerator Group, Highline, INcubes, Kinetic Café, MaRS, Multiplicity, OneEleven, University of Toronto's Creative Lab Destruction, Ryerson DMZ and Next Canada.[61] 

The notable example is the University of Toronto’s Creative Destruction Lab, which leads all other accelerators with over $180 million in equity raised across 36 companies as a result of its monthly competition model, which concentrates resources into select high-potential firms. 

## Growth in Hiring

Toronto’s tech job growth expected to account for 69% of Ontario’s hiring, and ~1/3rd of all jobs in Canada.

## Your policy ideas are crap.  Stoping making up the rules as you go, learn economic history. 

Average support for companies with less than $0.5 million in revenue was $4,333, while average support for companies with more than $20 million in revenue was $231,255.
