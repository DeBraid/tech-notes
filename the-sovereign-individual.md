# Chapter 1: The Year 2000

There is another industrial revolution afoot on Earth.  The Information Age is going to bring about radical changes in the political establishment.  Our 21st century comforts will morph into post-modern reality where bandwidth trumps borders and the sovereignty of the individual will trump that of states.

> Increasingly autonomous individuals and bankrupt, desperate governments will confront each other across a new divide.  We expect a radical restructuring of the nature of sovereignty and the **virtual death of politics** before the transition is over.
