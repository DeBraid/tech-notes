# Support Vector Machines

'Margin' is a term used describe distance between the line and the nearest point of the two classes. The best `decision surface` maximizes the `margin`, or distance between disparate classes.  
SVM prioritizes classification first, then optimizes for margin.  IOW, will get classification right first, then ensure max distance between classes.

### Outliers 

Are often ignored to optimize for separating line being drawn in the best fit for the overall data set.  SVM will somewhat mediate the effect of outliers.
